= SPORTSELLO

Sportsello is a social platform to connect sports fans with sports bars and other venues.
== About
Originally created as a Lighthouse Labs final project, it is written using Rails as an API and Vue.js as a frontend.
All of the Vue code is currently in the <tt>app/assets/javascripts/home.js.erb</tt> file, with plans to slowly refactor the code into single-file components to comply with Vue best practices. There are also plans to migrate the backend from Rails onto Node.js.

== Setup
To set up the app on your machine, please create a .env file following the .env.example and set up your own PostgreSQL database.  Make sure to run all relevant bundler, npm, and browserify commands.
